## Using Flows

### In Chatbot

Integrate WhatsApp Flows into your chatbot conversation flows:

1. Create a flow step with type "WhatsApp Flow"
2. Select the published flow
3. Configure the trigger message
4. Handle flow completion responses

### Via API

Send flows programmatically using the REST API:

```bash
POST /api/messages
{
  "contact_id": "...",
  "type": "flow",
  "flow_id": "...",
  "flow_token": "...",
  "header": "Complete Your Order",
  "body": "Please fill in the details below",
  "button_text": "Start"
}
```

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  Keep flows concise - users prefer shorter, focused experiences over lengthy multi-screen journeys.
</Tip>

<Note>
  WhatsApp Flows require a business verification and may not be available in all regions.
