## Overview

API keys provide an alternative to JWT tokens for authenticating API requests. They are ideal for server-to-server integrations, automation scripts, and third-party applications.

<Aside type="note">
  Only administrators can create and manage API keys.
</Aside>

## Authentication

Include your API key in the `X-API-Key` header:

```bash
curl -X GET "http://your-server:8080/api/contacts" \
  -H "X-API-Key: whm_a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6"
```

## List API Keys

Get all API keys for your organization.

```bash
GET /api/api-keys
```

### Response

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "name": "Production Integration",
      "key_prefix": "a1b2c3d4",
      "last_used_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "expires_at": "2025-12-31T23:59:59Z",
      "is_active": true,
      "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Create API Key

Create a new API key.

```bash
POST /api/api-keys
```

### Request Body

```json
{
  "name": "Production Integration",
  "expires_at": "2025-12-31T23:59:59Z"
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| name | string | Yes | Friendly name for the API key |
| expires_at | string | No | RFC3339 expiration date (null for no expiration) |

### Response

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "name": "Production Integration",
    "key": "whm_a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6",
    "key_prefix": "a1b2c3d4",
    "expires_at": "2025-12-31T23:59:59Z",
    "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

<Aside type="caution">
  The full API key is only shown once when created. Store it securely - you won't be able to retrieve it again.
</Aside>

## Delete API Key

Revoke an API key. This action is immediate and cannot be undone.

```bash
DELETE /api/api-keys/{id}
```

### Response

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "message": "API key deleted successfully"
  }
}
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Store keys securely** - Use environment variables or secret management systems
2. **Set expiration dates** - Use expiring keys when possible for better security
3. **Use descriptive names** - Name keys by their purpose (e.g., "CI/CD Pipeline", "CRM Integration")
4. **Rotate regularly** - Delete and recreate keys periodically
5. **Limit exposure** - Never commit API keys to version control

## Key Format

API keys follow the format: `whm_` followed by 32 hexadecimal characters.

Example: `whm_a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6`

## Permissions

API keys inherit the permissions of the admin user who created them, providing full access to all API endpoints including:

- Contact management and assignment
- Message sending
- Template and flow management
- Campaign management
- Chatbot configuration
- Analytics access
