## Overview

Whatomate's chatbot automation allows you to create intelligent, automated responses for your WhatsApp messages. From simple keyword-based replies to complex AI-powered conversations, you have full control over how your business responds to customers.

## Navigation

The Chatbot section in the sidebar provides access to all chatbot features:

- **Overview** - Dashboard with statistics and quick access to settings
- **Settings** - Configure chatbot behavior, business hours, and AI
- **Keywords** - Create keyword-based auto-responses
- **Flows** - Design multi-step conversation flows
- **AI Contexts** - Configure AI knowledge bases
- **Transfers** - View and manage agent transfer queue

## Chatbot Settings

Configure global chatbot behavior including greeting messages, fallback messages, and session settings.

### Greeting Message
The greeting message is automatically sent to new contacts when they first message your business (or after the session timeout expires). You can optionally add interactive buttons (up to 10) to guide users to common actions.

### Fallback Message
When no keyword rules, AI contexts, or conversation flows match an incoming message, the fallback message is sent. Like the greeting message, you can add interactive buttons to help users navigate.

### Interactive Buttons
Both greeting and fallback messages support WhatsApp interactive buttons:
- **1-3 buttons**: Displayed as quick reply buttons
- **4-10 buttons**: Displayed as a list menu

### Session Timeout
Configure how long a session remains active. When a user messages again after the timeout, they receive the greeting message as if starting a new conversation.

<Aside type="tip">
  Use buttons to guide users to common topics like "Track Order", "Speak to Agent", or "View Products".
</Aside>

## Business Hours

Configure when your chatbot is active and how it behaves outside business hours.

### Setting Up Business Hours

<Steps>

1. **Enable Business Hours**

   Toggle the business hours feature on in the Business Hours tab.

2. **Configure Daily Schedule**

   For each day of the week:
   - Enable or disable the day
   - Set opening and closing times

3. **Out of Hours Message**

   Configure a message to send when customers contact you outside business hours.

4. **Automated Responses Outside Hours**

   Choose whether to allow flows, keywords, and AI responses to work 24/7 (enabled by default) or restrict them to business hours only.

</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
  Even with business hours enabled, you can allow automated flows and keyword responses to work around the clock. This is useful for handling common inquiries while still informing customers of your operating hours.
</Aside>

## Keyword Rules

![Keyword Rules](/whatomate/images/03-keyword-rules.png)

Create automated responses triggered by specific keywords or phrases.

### Creating a Keyword Rule

![Keyword Rule Editor](/whatomate/images/04-keyword-rule-editor.png)

<Steps>

1. **Define Keywords**

   Add one or more keywords or phrases that will trigger the rule.

2. **Set Match Type**

   Choose how keywords should be matched:
   - **Exact** - Message must match exactly
   - **Contains** - Message contains the keyword
   - **Starts with** - Message begins with the keyword
   - **Regex** - Use regular expressions for complex patterns

3. **Configure Response**

   Set the response type and content:
   - Text message
   - Template message
   - Media (image, video, document)
   - Trigger a conversation flow

4. **Set Priority**

   Assign priority to determine which rule applies when multiple rules match.

</Steps>

## AI Settings

Configure AI-powered responses to handle queries that don't match keywords or flows.

### Enabling AI Responses

<Steps>

1. **Choose an AI Provider**

   Select from OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google AI.

2. **Select a Model**

   Choose the model that best fits your needs and budget.

3. **Configure API Key**

   Enter your API key from the provider (stored securely and encrypted).

4. **Set System Prompt**

   Define how the AI should behave and what context it should use for responses.

</Steps>

### Supported AI Providers

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="OpenAI" icon="setting">
    GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4-turbo
  </Card>
  <Card title="Anthropic" icon="setting">

  </Card>
  <Card title="Google AI" icon="setting">

  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## AI Contexts

![AI Contexts](/whatomate/images/05-ai-contexts.png)

Enhance your chatbot with AI-powered responses using contexts that provide relevant information to the AI.

### Creating an AI Context

![AI Context Editor](/whatomate/images/06-ai-context-editor.png)

AI Contexts allow you to:
- Define static knowledge bases
- Connect to external APIs for dynamic data
- Set trigger keywords for context activation
- Configure priority for multiple contexts

## Conversation Flows

![Conversation Flows](/whatomate/images/07-conversation-flows.png)

Design multi-step conversation flows with branching logic to guide customers through complex interactions.

### Flow Builder

![Conversation Flow Builder](/whatomate/images/08-conversation-flow-builder.png)

The visual flow builder allows you to:
- Create multiple conversation steps
- Define user input types (text, buttons, lists)
- Store responses in variables
- Add conditional branching
- Configure completion actions

### Flow Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Input Validation** | Validate user responses with regex patterns |
| **Variable Storage** | Store user inputs for later use in the conversation |
| **Conditional Logic** | Branch based on user responses |
| **API Integration** | Fetch data from external APIs during the flow |
| **Webhook Headers** | Configure custom headers for API calls and completion webhooks |
| **Agent Transfer** | Transfer to human agent when needed |
| **WhatsApp Flows** | Integrate native WhatsApp Flows |
| **Drag & Drop Ordering** | Reorder steps by dragging them to new positions |

## Agent Transfers

Hand off conversations from the chatbot to human agents when needed.

### How Transfers Work

When a conversation is transferred:
1. The chatbot stops processing messages for that contact
2. All messages are visible to the assigned agent
3. The agent can respond and manage the conversation
4. When done, the agent can resume chatbot processing

### Transfer Triggers

Transfers can be initiated in three ways:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Manual Transfer" icon="forward">
    Agents/managers can click "Transfer to Agent" from the chat view to manually transfer a conversation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Conversation Flow" icon="workflow">
    Add a transfer step in your conversation flow to hand off to agents at specific points.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Keyword Rule" icon="key">
    Configure keywords like "talk to agent" or "human" to automatically trigger a transfer.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

### Queue Management

#### For Agents

Agents see the **Transfers** view in their sidebar with:
- **My Transfers** - Conversations currently assigned to them
- **Pick Next** button - Claim the next available transfer from the queue (if enabled)

<Aside type="note">
  When picking from the queue, agents don't see contact details until the transfer is assigned to them. This ensures fair FIFO (first-in-first-out) distribution.
</Aside>

#### For Admins/Managers

Admins and managers have full visibility into the queue and can:
- View all unassigned transfers with contact details
- Assign transfers to specific agents
- View transfer history
- Resume transfers (return to chatbot)

### Queue Settings

Configure queue behavior in **Chatbot > Settings**:

- **Allow Agents to Pick from Queue** - When enabled, agents can self-assign transfers by clicking "Pick Next". When disabled, only admins/managers can assign transfers.

### Transfer Lifecycle

<Steps>

1. **Transfer Created**

   A transfer is created via manual action, flow step, or keyword rule. The contact is assigned to the queue or an existing agent.

2. **Agent Assignment**

   Either the agent picks from the queue, or an admin assigns the transfer.

3. **Agent Handling**

   The agent communicates with the customer. The chatbot is paused for this contact.

4. **Resume Chatbot**

   When the conversation is complete, the agent clicks "Resume" to return the contact to chatbot processing.

</Steps>

### Auto-Assignment

If a contact already has an assigned agent (from a previous conversation), new transfers for that contact are automatically assigned to the same agent.

<Aside type="tip">
  Use transfers strategically to handle complex inquiries that require human judgment while letting the chatbot manage routine questions.
